## Projects

### [Analysis of Blood Supply & Demand Dynamics](https://github.com/2p990i9hpral/Factors_Dominating_Blood_Supply_Dynamics/blob/master/README-EN.md)
- Modeled blood supply and demand during crisis situations using time-series analysis.
- Quantitatively measured the effectiveness of promotional campaigns based on blood donor characteristics.
- Visualized analysis results and proposed strategies for more efficient promotional activities.

### [Development of LLM-Powered AI Agent](https://github.com/2p990i9hpral/Portfolio/blob/main/projects/llm_powered_ai_agent-EN.md)
- Utilized OpenAI-compatible LLM API for natural language understanding, reasoning, and response generation.
- Implemented a dynamic function-calling architecture where the LLM determines which external API to call based on user queries.
- Constructed a local database to manage conversation history, user statistics, internal logging, and detailed LLM token/cost tracking.

### [NLP-driven Language Learning: Data Analysis, Visualization, & Personalized Recommendations](https://forum.lingq.com/t/lingq-data-analysis-visualizing-patterns-in-my-known-words/1410961?u=vet8t6z79pc4)
- Preprocessed large-scale personal language learning data and performed Part-of-Speech (POS) frequency analysis using NLP techniques.
- Derived statistical insights into learning patterns and identified unknown vocabulary to prioritize learning efforts.
- Visualized word embeddings, constructed vocabulary topic maps, and designed a prototype for a personalized, topic-based vocabulary learning recommendation system.

### [Development of LLM-based Language Learning Tools](https://github.com/2p990i9hpral/LingQ_Add-On)
- Implemented an AI chatbot and AI-TTS features for language learning leveraging LLM models.
- Engineered prompts to provide context-aware, structured definitions, translations, and explanations for user-selected words/sentences.
- Optimized LLM response accuracy and consistency for various use-cases through refined prompt design.
- Developed vocabulary data extraction based on learning progress, creating a data foundation for analyzing user learning patterns and offering personalized recommendations.
